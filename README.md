# Snek Game

Welcome to the Snek game! This classic arcade game allows you to control a snake as it moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. Be careful not to collide with the walls or yourself!

## How to Play

1. **Controls**:
   - Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake:
     - Up arrow: Move the snake up
     - Down arrow: Move the snake down
     - Left arrow: Move the snake left
     - Right arrow: Move the snake right

2. **Objective**:
   - Eat the food (red square) that appears on the screen to grow longer.
   - Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. Collision ends the game.

3. **Scoring**:
   - Each food eaten increases your score.
   - Try to achieve the highest score possible!

4. **Game Over**:
   - The game ends when the snek collides with the walls or itself.
   - Your final score will be displayed on the screen.
